#
# This is sp, the command-line Spotify controller. It talks to a running
# instance of the Spotify Linux client over dbus, providing an interface not
# unlike mpc.
#
# Put differently, it allows you to control Spotify without leaving the comfort
# of your command line, and without a custom client or Premium subscription.
#
# As an added bonus, it also works with ssh, at and cron.
#
# Example:
# $ sp weather girls raining men
# $ sp current
# Album   100 Hits Of The '80s
# Artist  The Weather Girls
# Title   It's Raining Men
# $ sp pause
#
# Alarm clock example:
# $ at 7:45 <<< 'sp bangarang'
#
# Remote example:
# $ ssh vader@prod02.nomoon.ta 'sp imperial march'
